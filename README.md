# Ember-Boilerplate

_(Ember Boilerplate & Charcoal are very much a work-in-progress at the moment! Feel free to contribute suggestions or code.)_

Ember Boilerplate is a template for Ember.js apps. To generate a new app based on it, use the [Charcoal](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Charcoal) build tool.
